# About
As an experienced full-stack developer, I have successfully delivered a large project for three traveling companies in Egypt. With a solid background in web development and full-stack development, I have a strong command of TypeScript/JavaScript and modern frameworks such as NestJS and Next.js. I am also skilled in unit testing, problem-solving, and writing clean, efficient code.

In addition to my core competencies, I am proficient in using GitHub and Git for version control and have advanced expertise in web scraping using Python. I have also dabbled in machine learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn.

My passion for writing efficient and well-structured code drives me to constantly explore new technologies and approaches. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of my clients and thrive on tackling complex challenges.

Currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills and experience to deliver innovative solutions that drive business success.
